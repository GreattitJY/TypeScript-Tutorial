# TypeScript Boolean

The TypeScript `boolean` type allows two values: `ture` and `false`. it`s one of the primitive types in TypeScript.

```ts
let pending: boolean;
pending = true;
// after a while
// ..
pending = false;
```

JavaScript has the `Boolean` type that refers to the non-primitive boxed object. The `Boolean` type has the letter `B` in uppercase, which is different from the `boolean` type.

It`s a good practice to avoid using the `Boolean` type.
